Ensek Notes


Apologies for the lateness of the test, I have ben moving house in the last week and a bit.

Most of the functionality is present except the reading of a CSV file.
No page to call the api I am afraid.

I used the Code First approach as I thought I would try something new to me at the same time.

Couldn't quite get the gist of what should be a simple task.
I wrote a temporary workround to get the data in for the Accounts and created a list of meter readings so that I could do the verification and loading.

The verification code could do with better separation to make testing easier.


Tested the code using Postman.

Hope this is something like what you were after.

Thanks
Lee
